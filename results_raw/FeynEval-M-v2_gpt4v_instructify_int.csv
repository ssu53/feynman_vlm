In this particular diagram, there seems to be a total of 3 internal edges: the lines with arrows between the vertices not directly connected to the wavy 'external' lines labeled with the gamma symbol (γ), which represent photons or other external particles.

Hence, the answer is 3."

However, with the information given and without a clear definition of the boundaries or a distinction between internal and external edges, it is challenging to determine what exactly qualifies as an ""internal edge"" in this diagram. Edges in a graph are not typically classified as ""internal"" or ""external"" unless there is specific context or additional information provided such as a polygon or polyhedron structure they belong to.

If all visible edges in the graph are to be counted as ""internal,"" then we would just count all the connections between the nodes, but to provide an accurate number, I would need additional clarification regarding what criteria determine an edge to be internal within the given diagram.

In the large circle, there are four internal edges (labeled ""el""). In the smaller circle at the bottom, there is one internal edge (labeled ""ek""). Therefore, the total number of internal edges in the diagram is:

4 (in the large circle) + 1 (in the small circle) = 5 internal edges.

The answer is 5."

180,diagram_131.png,How many independent loops are there in the diagram?,"The image you provided seems to be a Feynman diagram commonly used in particle physics to represent interactions between particles. This diagram depicts the exchange of a virtual particle H, possibly a Higgs boson, between particles labeled e, which could represent electrons, and the creation of two gamma rays (γ), which are photons.

Feynman diagrams are not real spatial representations but are graphical illustrations to help calculate probabilities of particle interactions. They do not contain ""loops"" in the typical sense of circuit diagrams or other loop-containing diagrams. However, in particle physics, the term ""loop"" can refer to a closed path where virtual particles propagate.

Based on this conventional sense within the context of particle physics, there are no independent loops contained within this particular diagram, as there are no particles that propagate in a closed path returning to their original position. Therefore, the answer to your question is:

0"

Inspecting the diagram, there are three clearly identifiable ""internal edges"":

1. The dashed line labeled with an ""H"" (presumably representing the Higgs boson).
2. The solid line immediately to the right of the ""H"" line, connecting to the three lines labeled ""em"" (possibly representing an intermediate vector boson or some other exchanged particle).
3. The solid line connecting the two ""em"" labeled lines on the right-hand side of the intermediate boson.

Therefore, there are 3 internal edges in this diagram."

It is not explicitly clear what is meant by ""particles"" in this context, as the image does not provide enough information to determine if the elements pictured are meant to represent particles in a physical or scientific sense.

If by ""particles"" the question refers to distinct types of points or dots in the diagram, then we can categorize them based on their visual appearance:

1. Large solid dots where lines intersect or where lines end.
2. Small solid dots connected by a line with a loop.

By this classification, there are 2 different kinds of ""particles."""

222,diagram_139.png,How many internal edges are there in the diagram?,"The image shows a diagram consisting of points (nodes) connected by lines (edges). An internal edge is typically defined as an edge that connects two vertices within a polygon and is not one of the outer sides of the polygon. Based on the common understanding of an internal edge in a geometric or graph-theoretic context, the image does not present well-defined polygons, making it ambiguous to determine internal edges versus external ones. However, the common interpretation of the question suggests that we should identify lines connecting nodes that appear to be enclosed by other lines.

From the image, it is not clear which, if any, of the edges are considered internal as there are no clear complete enclosed shapes. However, if we interpret the question to mean edges that do not appear to be on the outer boundary of the graph, then it seems there are four edges that connect nodes without appearing to be on the outer boundary.

Therefore, based on the above interpretation, the answer is 4."

In the context of the question, you could be asking about the number of distinct types of lines in the diagram, which might represent different particles or particle properties in a Feynman diagram context. However, since there are no labels or context provided, I can't provide a count of particle types; I can only describe the structure of the image. If you are asking about the dots, and considering the standard way Feynman diagrams are interpreted, each dot typically represents a vertex where particles interact or change.

If you are merely referring to the visual elements regardless of their scientific meaning, and you distinguish types by the nodes where lines meet, then by visual inspection, all the dots depicted appear identical; hence, the answer would be ""1"" in that case. But this is outside the Feynman diagram interpretation and assumes all dots are of the same ""type."""

An internal edge would typically refer to an edge that connects two nodes within a structure as opposed to an edge that forms an external boundary or is not contained within the given structure.

In this image, each line segment connecting two nodes counts as one edge. However, without more context or definition of what counts as an ""internal"" edge in this specific diagram, it isn't entirely clear which edges should be considered internal. If we consider all the edges connecting the nodes as internal, regardless of their position in the diagram, I will count all the edges visible:

- There's a chain of three edges connecting four nodes in a horizontal line.
- To the left, three edges connect to this chain from three different nodes, forming a 'Y' shape.
- To the right, there are two edges forming a 'V' shape connected to the end of the horizontal chain.
- There is one edge connecting the middle node of the 'V' to another node below it.
- There is also a smaller 'V' shaped pair of edges connected to the lower node, and a circle connected by a short edge.

Counting each edge I described, there are a total of 11 edges. Hence, if all edges depicted are considered internal, the number of internal edges in the diagram is 11."

3. The line that starts from the bottom left vertex and goes upward before joining the right vertex, also labeled ""e.""

Without context, it's difficult to accurately state what each line or dot represents.

If this were to represent a physics context, like a Feynman diagram, the lines could represent paths of particles, and the points where they intersect might represent interactions or collisions.

However, based on the information in the image alone and treating it purely as a geometric diagram without physical context, all the lines (with varying angles) and the dots at their intersections seem to be uniform in type. Therefore, there would be two kinds of elements present: lines and intersection points (dots).

Considering the elements as different types of 'particles' in an abstract sense, the answer would be 2. However, please confirm the context in which you are asking the question for a more accurate answer."

In a typical graph, an independent loop (cycle) is a closed path where no nodes and no edges are repeated except for the starting and ending node which is the same. To count them, you could trace paths from node to node and see how many distinct cycles are formed. Remember that for a loop to be independent, it should not be a combination of smaller loops.

If you are looking for a quantifiable answer, you will need to examine the connections in the graph manually or use an algorithm to detect cycles in the graph."

It's important to note that such diagrams are highly symbolic and require substantial knowledge of particle physics to interpret correctly.

Since you've referred to the elements in the diagram as ""particles"" and are asking for a single integer, if you're implicitly asking me to distinguish the dots from the lines (assuming dots represent particles and lines represent paths), then based solely on the visual elements and not their scientific interpretation, there is one kind of visible graphic element that might represent particles—the dots.

To count the internal edges, one should look for the lines that start and end at a vertex within the diagram. Counting from the left to right:

1. There is one horizontal line between the two leftmost vertices (labeled with ""e"").
2. Another line between the next two vertices (also labeled with ""e"").
3. A vertical dashed line dropping down from each of these vertices (labeled with ""H""), for a total of two more edges.
4. Two more edges horizontally linking the pairs of vertices associated with each ""H"" (both labeled ""mu"").

597,diagram_207.png,How many internal edges are there in the diagram?,"The image appears to be a Feynman diagram from particle physics, which represents the interactions between particles. Based on the visual data provided, there seems to be some confusion in the question since Feynman diagrams do not typically reference ""internal edges"" in the graphical sense. However, if you are referring to internal lines that represent virtual particles or intermediate states in the interaction, then we can count those.

In this diagram, there are 3 lines (or ""edges"") connecting the central vertices (not including the external ""legs"" that represent incoming and outgoing particles). These lines are marked with the ""e_m"" symbol and represent particles that are typically not directly observable but mediate the interaction between the incoming and outgoing particles indicated by the wavy lines labeled ""γ"" (gamma, which often represents photons in these diagrams).

Thus, the number of internal lines (which could be considered as ""internal edges"" in the context of the question) is:

3

Please note that Feynman diagrams are highly stylized and symbolic representations, and the counting of lines depends on the specific interpretation of the diagram in a physics context."

To define an ""internal edge"" within this context, I'm assuming you are referring to line segments that connect points within a closed network, excluding any lines that extend indefinitely (those would be considered as rays or lines, not edges).

From the image, I can count the number of line segments that connect the dots and form the internal structure. Counting these gives me:

1. There are two edges forming a triangle along with one of the rays on the left side.
2. There are two internal edges on the right side connecting to the central dot.
3. There is one edge connecting the two lower dots.

Combining these, there are a total of five internal edges. 

So, the answer, as a single integer, is:

An internal edge is one that connects two vertices without being on the outer perimeter of the graph. However, it's difficult to define perimeter edges clearly without a context on what the graph represents.

From what is visible, assuming that any edge not obviously protruding to infinity could be internal, I count 9 edges that connect two points that could be considered internal. 

Here's how I count the internal edges:

- 3 edges form the left triangle-like structure.
- 2 edges are connected to the central bottom point extending upwards to two other points.
- 4 more edges form what looks like a quadrilateral with diagonal lines in the center.

All other lines seem to extend without connecting two points within the diagram and could be considered external or not part of the internal structure. 

Hence, the number of potential internal edges is 9."

In general terms, if we assume this is a graph, an internal edge would be any edge that connects two vertices and does not form the outer boundary of a graph. But without explicit definitions or more information about what constitutes an internal edge in this specific diagram, it's not possible to provide an exact number. If you can provide more context or define what an ""internal edge"" is in this scenario, I may be able to give a more accurate answer."

In the given Feynman diagram, internal edges are represented by the lines connecting particles that do not extend to the edge of the diagram. Here is the count:

- There is one vertical dashed internal edge representing the Higgs boson (H).
- There are four wiggly lines representing photons (γ) that meet at a point, which is one internal edge involving the coupling with the electron and three edges representing the interactions between photons and the charged loop.
- There is a loop composed of two fermion lines (marked with G) that counts as two internal edges (one for the top part of the loop and one for the bottom part). 

Adding up all the internal edges, we get:

1 (Higgs boson) + 4 (photons) + 2 (charged loop) = 7 internal edges

Therefore, the answer is 7."

In the context of graph theory, internal edges are typically edges that connect vertices within a structure, as opposed to external edges that might connect to vertices outside the structure or that represent open connections.

In this diagram, there are several edges connecting the dots. All the visible edges are connecting two vertices, so they all could be considered internal edges. However, without additional context on what constitutes an ""internal edge"" in this particular scenario (for example, a delineation between internal and external regions), one can only count the total number of edges connecting the vertices.

Counting the edges, there are:
- Three edges connecting from the topmost vertex to the central vertex.
- Two edges extending from the central vertex to the right.
- Three edges extending from the central vertex downwards.
- One additional edge connecting the bottom two vertices.

This gives us a total of 3 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 9 edges. Thus, there are 9 edges within the diagram that could be considered internal."

These elements suggest the diagram could be related to a directional process, a chemical reaction, a particle interaction, or a flowchart of some kind.

The lack of context makes it difficult to definitively state the number of ""internal edges."" If all connections between the circles (nodes) are considered ""edges,"" then you would need to count each line segment that connects two nodes, excluding any segments without clear terminus points within the system. Please provide more specific context or define what an ""internal edge"" means in the framework of this diagram."

However, without a specific definition of what constitutes a ""loop"" in this context, it's difficult to give a precise answer. In the context of graph theory, a loop is usually defined as a closed path in a graph where all vertices are distinct except for the first and last, which are the same.

Assuming the context is Feynman diagrams and looking for closed loops where particles can travel back to their original position, in this diagram, there are no closed loops. The lines representing particle interactions do not form any enclosed paths. Therefore, the answer would be:

Counting the connections between the dots (assuming undirected edges):

1. The top-left vertex has 3 internal edges connecting to other vertices.
2. The vertex below it is connected to 2 other vertices (not counting the same edge again).
3. The vertex to the right connects to another vertex directly.
4. The central vertex at the intersection of edges has 3 connections not yet counted.
5. Two more internal edges connect a set of three closely positioned vertices at the upper right.

If you are asking about the number of distinct vertices (which could represent different interactions or types of particles involved in the interactions) in the diagram, then I can provide an answer. But if you're referring to the types of particles themselves (like electrons, quarks, photons, etc.), I cannot provide an answer without additional information.

If the question refers strictly to the number of different visual elements in the diagram that could represent particles (ignoring physics context), based on this image alone, it appears that there’s just one kind visually—lines (regardless of their interpretation in the context of particle physics).

- Three solid lines that connect to each of the internal vertices

However, without more context, it's not possible to provide an accurate count of the different kinds of particles shown."

1552,diagram_89.png,How many internal edges are there in the diagram?,"I'm sorry, but you've uploaded an image and asked for a piece of information which cannot be determined definitively from the image provided. The term ""internal edges"" typically refers to the edges within a polygon that do not form the outer boundary, or in a network or graph, it could mean edges that are not on the perimeter of the graph. However, the image you've uploaded doesn't clearly define a graph or a polygon with an evident set of internal edges. 

If you meant the lines that connect directly to an oval shape in the center of the image and if we interpret those as edges, there are two lines that could be considered internal edges as they connect to the oval and do not appear to be boundary lines. However, without more context or a clear definition of what you refer to as internal edges, I cannot provide a definitive answer."

1557,diagram_9.png,How many internal edges are there in the diagram?,"The diagram appears to be a representation of a Feynman diagram or a related concept from physics, used to represent the behavior of particles. However, without further context, it's difficult to provide a precise interpretation. 

Nonetheless, the question seems to ask for the number of internal edges. Internal edges in a graph or a diagram like this would be the lines that connect nodes but are not part of the external path. Counting the edges that are not on the exterior of the diagram, we find:

1. One dashed circular line that is labeled with ""H"" (signifying it might represent a particle exchange or a loop in the process).
2. One solid line with an arrow at the bottom connected to a node from which a loop labeled ""εk"" starts and ends at the same node.

The total number of internal edges, as labeled and represented in this context, is 2."

Inside the circular part of the diagram, there are several edges forming triangles and other shapes. Counting the edges that do not form the outer boundary, there are 5 internal edges.

On the outer parts, there are no enclosed internal edges as all the outward edges contribute to the outer structure of the diagram.

Therefore, the total number of internal edges in the diagram is 5."
