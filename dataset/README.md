# PLD

Download the `.png` images of the 24 Principal Landau Determinants diagrams from https://mathrepo.mis.mpg.de/PLD/.

Place them in the local directory `./pld`.


# Arxiv

Download from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-DacKClm3ySie3RD8Dgx9w9dSjxTfNhb and place in `./arxiv`.

Unzip the two zip files to produce `./arxiv/feynman_in_caption` and `./arxiv/feynman_in_paragraph_10k`.

The updates to FeynEval-M are:

- Resizing all figures to 512x512
- Adding more variation in the font size, types of particles, number of legs, etc.
- Removing by hand the illegible diagrams with edges on top of each other (I left in the cases in which edges cross without overlapping). I would expect that every diagram should be doable by a human now. There's still a bunch of diagrams for which the task is challenging but doable. Please feel free to discard more images that you think are too misleading.

FeynEval-H references the same set of diagrams, with multiple choice questions in `FeynEval-H.json`.
